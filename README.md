## Background
Humans Since 1982 are a Sweden based artist studio, established in 2009 by founding artists Bastian Bischoff and Per Emanuelsson. One of their projects named the "ClockClock" caught my eye as a really interesting way of diplaying the time. It uses an array of analog clock faces to create the same kind of image a 7-segment display would. This array of seperate clock faces can then work together to create patterns as transitions between times.

It is, however, ludicrously expensive - the artists sell them for â‚¬5,400 on their website. The engineer in me figured that it surely wouldn't cost anywhere near that to replicate, and would make a cool project as well. This repository details everything that went into creating a near-perfect replica of this product.
